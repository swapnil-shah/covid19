However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p><p>Learn more about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/essential-goods-services.html">safe handling of deliveries and mail</a>.</p>'
